# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
### PyBer has tasked us to analyze a ride-sharing app company which is valued at $2.3 billion. The analysis is to be done on all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. We have been asked to create a compelling visualization for the CEO including the following:

- A bubble chart showcasing the average fare verses the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including **Urban**, **Suburban**, and **Rural**.
- A box-and-whiskers plot that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
	- The number of rides for each city type.
	- The fares for each city type.
	- The number of drivers for each city type.
- A pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
	-The percent of total fares.
	-The percent of total rides.
	-The percent of total drivers.
- The mean, median, and mode for the following:
	-The total number of rides for each city type.
	-The average fares for each city type.
	-The total number of drivers for each city type.
- A multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
### The multiple-line graph of the total weekly fares by city type highlights the differences per city. In the graph below you can see the following:

- Urban cities seem to have a much higher total fares than Rural and Suburban cities.
- Towards the end of february, it appears across city types total ride fare price hit an all time high of the time-period in our dataset. 
- Rural cities seem to have the least amount of rides than the other two city types.

In addition to the multiple-line graph above, the table below provides a summary of averages fares per ride for each city type. This table highlights more differences:

- Rural cities seem to have the least number of rides of the time-period, due to having he lowest amount of drivers and offering the highest fare price than the other two city types.
- Urban cities had the most number of rides over the time-period offering the lowest fare price per ride.

## Summary
### In summary, per the analysis of the ride sharing app three business recommendations to address the disparities among the city types are:

1. Leverage or promote for more drivers in the rural and suburban cities in order to meet the same number of drivers in urban cities. This will help equalize the amount of rides across the cities. 
2. Set a fare per driver to be equal across all city types to make ride sharing more accessible and fair across cities.
3. Continue to analyze the ride sharing data periodically to see how changes or different months changes the results. By periodically analyzing the ride sharing data you can find more ways for improvement.
